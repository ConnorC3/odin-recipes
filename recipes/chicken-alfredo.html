        <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken alfredo is a creamy, indulgent pasta dish that combines tender slices of seasoned chicken with a
            rich and velvety Alfredo sauce, all tossed with fettuccine noodles. The sauce, made with butter, heavy
            cream, and Parmesan cheese, creates a smooth and luscious coating that clings to each strand of pasta. The
            dish is simple yet decadent, offering a perfect balance of savory, cheesy, and garlicky flavors. Whether
            served for a cozy family dinner or a special occasion, chicken alfredo is a comforting and satisfying meal
            that is easy to prepare.

            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>½ tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>12 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt (for boiling water)</li>
            <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>½ tsp Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
            <li>½ cup pasta water (reserved)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over
                medium heat. Cook the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side until golden brown and fully cooked (165°F
                internal temperature). Remove from the pan, let it rest, then slice into thin strips.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and fettuccine, cooking until al dente (according to
                package instructions). Reserve ½ cup of pasta water before draining.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds
                until fragrant. Pour in heavy cream, stirring continuously. Lower the heat and mix in Parmesan cheese,
                salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Stir until the cheese melts and the sauce thickens (about 3-5
                minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce, tossing to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the
                reserved pasta water until it reaches the desired consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top with sliced chicken and garnish with extra Parmesan and chopped parsley if desired. Serve warm and
                enjoy!

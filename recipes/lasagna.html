    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta,
      savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and melted cheese, all
      baked to perfection. Each bite delivers a comforting blend of textures and
      flavors, from the tender noodles to the hearty filling and the golden,
      bubbly topping. The combination of tomatoes, garlic, and herbs infuses the
      dish with warmth, making it a beloved meal for family gatherings and
      special occasions.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook lasagna noodles according to package
        instructions, then drain and set aside.

        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned.
        Add the diced onion and garlic, cooking until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and
        pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix ricotta cheese with the egg until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a
        layer of meat sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Repeat layers until
        all ingredients are used, ending with sauce and mozzarella.

        Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and cover with foil. Bake for 25
        minutes, then remove foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until
